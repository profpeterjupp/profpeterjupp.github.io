The set of vectorcardiogram data described in 
Downs, Liebman and Mackay (1971) is a classic data set on the rotation 
group SO(3).
<P>

The data set summarises vectorcardiograms of 98 normal children aged 2-19.  
Each child has data from two vectorcardiograms: 
one using the Frank system for electrical lead placement, the other using the McFee lead system.

Each vectorcardiogram has 3 unit vectors associated with it. They are:
<BR>
<B>q</B>: the spatial direction of the vector of the QRS loop having the greatest magnitude,
<BR>
<B>p</B>: the unit vector perpendicular to QRS and to the 'QRS plane' (the 
plane containing the QRS loop),
<BR>
<B>t</B>: the spatial direction of the vector of the T loop having the greatest 
magnitude.
<BR>
A more detailed explanation of these vectors is given in Section 2 of Downs, 
Liebman and Mackay (1971).
The vectors <B>q</B> and <B>p</B> are orthogonal and the frame <BR>
<I>(<B>q</B>, <B>p</B>)</I> gives the orientation of the QRS loop.

<P>

In the worksheet, the unit vectors <B>q</B>, <B>p</B> and <B>t</B> are expressed in rectangular 
<I>x,y,t</I> coordinates to five decimal places.  
These coordinates are identified numerically as <BR>
<I>x=1</I>, <I>y=2</I> and <I>t=3</I>;
the lead systems are identified by F and M for the Frank and McFee systems, respectively;
and the unit vectors <B>q</B>, <B>p</B> and <B>t</B> are identified by QRS, PRP and T, respectively.  
For example, column E is labelled <I>FQRS3</I> and is thus the <I>t</I> coordinate of the 
QRS vector for the Frank lead system. 
<P>

The age-sex groupings used in column B are: <BR>
1: 28 boys aged 2-10 <BR>
2: 28 boys aged 2-19 <BR>
3: 17 girls aged 2-10 <BR>
4: 25 girls aged 2-19 <BR>
