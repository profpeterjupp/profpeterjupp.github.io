The topic of directional statistics is concerned typically with 
observations which are <I>directions</I> (unit vectors in <I>R<sup>p</sup></I>), 
<I>axes</I> (lines through the origin of <I>R<sup>p</sup></I>),
or <I>rotations</I> of <I>R<sup>p</sup></I>. 
More generally, observations can be points in a compact Riemannian manifold.

A famous data set</a> on the rotation group SO(3) is the set of 
<a href="./vcg.html">vectorcardiogram data</a> of 
Downs, Liebman and Mackay (1971).
